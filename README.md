## Template information

In addition to the original work put into formatting this resume, it is based on several pieces of two resume templates.

The overall format is based on a sample resume published by Dan McGee at [toofishes.net](https://www.toofishes.net/), found in [this blog post](https://www.toofishes.net/blog/latex-resume-follow-up/).

Additional formatting was based on Zach Scrivena's "simple-resume-cv" template, which can [be found here](https://github.com/zachscrivena/simple-resume-cv).
