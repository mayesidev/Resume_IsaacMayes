# Isaac Mayes's resume

This is Isaac Mayes's resume. It is written in LaTeX (initially, as an excuse to learn LaTeX), after often hearing how highly praised the system is for document formatting.

## Template information

In addition to all original work put into formatting this resume, it was primarily based on two resume templates.

The main format is based on a sample resume published by Dan McGee at [toofishes.net](https://www.toofishes.net/), found in [this blog post](https://www.toofishes.net/blog/latex-resume-follow-up/).

Additional formatting was based on Zach Scrivena's "simple-resume-cv" template, which can [be found here](https://github.com/zachscrivena/simple-resume-cv).
